**Developed by Chris Martens | Based on the original Passwordless Login plugin by Cozmoslabs**


== Installation ==

1. Upload the keyless-auth folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Keyless Auth > Templates to configure email templates and colors
1. Create a new page and use the shortcode [keyless-auth]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this secure? =

	Yes. The token is created using wp_hash and it's based on the user id, the current time and the salt in wp-config.php

= Couldn't anyone login if they have that link? =

	The token expires after 10 minutes and can only be used once. If people have access to that link it's supposed they have access to your email, in which case it's as safe as the default login, since they could reset their passwords.

= Isn't it more complicated they just entering a password? =

	Weak passwords are used every day by users. There are also people who use the same password across various services and websites. By using the Keyless Auth plugin your users will have one less password to worry about.

= How do I customize the email templates? =

	Go to Keyless Auth > Templates in your WordPress admin. You can choose from predefined templates (German or English) or create your own custom HTML template using the built-in WYSIWYG editor with full HTML and CSS support.

= Can I change the colors in the emails? =

	Yes! In the settings page, you can customize button colors, button hover colors, and link colors. Supports multiple color formats including hex (#007bff), RGB (rgb(0,123,255)), HSL (hsl(211,100%,50%)), and HSLA colors. You can use either color pickers or enter color codes manually.

= Does the custom email editor support HTML? =

	Absolutely! The custom template editor includes a full WYSIWYG editor with HTML support. You can create rich email templates with custom styling, different font sizes, colors, tables, and more. Switch between visual and HTML editing modes as needed.

= How do I configure SMTP for reliable email delivery? =

	Go to Keyless Auth > SMTP in your WordPress admin. You can configure SMTP settings for providers like Gmail, Outlook, Mailgun, SendGrid, and more. The plugin includes automatic port configuration for SSL/TLS, connection testing, and debug tools to ensure your emails are delivered reliably.

= Can I track what emails are being sent? =

	Yes! The Mail Logs feature allows you to monitor all emails sent from your WordPress site. You can view complete email history with timestamps, recipients, subjects, and even preview the full email content. This is perfect for troubleshooting delivery issues and monitoring your site's email activity.

= Can I customize the sender name in emails? =

	Absolutely! In the SMTP settings, you can enable "Force From Name" and set a custom sender name like "Your Website Name" instead of just showing the email address. This makes emails look more professional and branded. The feature includes a toggle control so you can easily enable or disable it.

= Can I store SMTP credentials securely outside the database? =

	Yes! Version 2.0.4 introduces secure credential storage options. You can choose to store SMTP username and password in wp-config.php instead of the database. This is more secure as wp-config.php is typically outside the web root. Simply add these constants to your wp-config.php:
	
	`define('CHRMRTNS_PA_SMTP_USERNAME', 'your-email@example.com');`
	`define('CHRMRTNS_PA_SMTP_PASSWORD', 'your-smtp-password');`
	
	Then select "Store in wp-config.php" in the SMTP settings.

= How do I set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? =

	Go to Keyless Auth > Options in your WordPress admin and enable "Two-Factor Authentication". You can then configure which user roles require 2FA and manage individual users who have 2FA enabled. Users can set up 2FA by visiting their profile page where they'll see a QR code to scan with Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP-compatible app.

= Can I require 2FA for specific user roles only? =

	Yes! In the 2FA settings, you can select which user roles should be required to use 2FA. For example, you might require 2FA for Administrators and Editors while leaving it optional for Subscribers. Users in required roles will be prompted to set up 2FA on their next login.

= How does 2FA work with magic links? =

	When 2FA is enabled, the magic link authentication flow is enhanced for security. If a user has 2FA enabled (or their role requires it), they'll first receive the magic link email, but after clicking the link, they'll be prompted to enter their 2FA code before being logged in. This prevents 2FA bypass vulnerabilities.

= What's different from the original Passwordless Login plugin? =

	This enhanced version includes: modular class-based architecture, complete Two-Factor Authentication system, SMTP configuration, email logging & monitoring, WYSIWYG email editor, visual template previews, advanced color controls (hex/RGB/HSL), separate button and link colors, dedicated admin menu, enhanced security with comprehensive nonce verification, HTML email support, and professional styling options.

= What does the modular architecture mean for developers? =

	In v2.0.1, we completely refactored the plugin from a single 1868-line file into clean, organized classes. Each functionality (authentication, SMTP, mail logging, email templates, admin interface) is now in its own dedicated class file. This makes the code much easier to maintain, extend, and debug. Developers can now easily customize specific features without affecting others.

= Why did you create this plugin? What inspired Keyless Auth? =

	Great question! We built Keyless Auth out of real-world frustration with password complexity and user experience challenges. The story involves too many plugins, security concerns, and the quest for the perfect balance between usability and security. Read the full story behind the plugin's creation: [How Many Plugins Are Too Many? Just One More: Why We Built Keyless Auth](https://chris-martens.com/blog/how-many-plugins-are-too-many-just-one-more-why-we-built-keyless-auth/)

= Password login not working with [keyless-auth-full] shortcode? =

	If the password login form reloads without logging in or showing errors, but magic link login works fine, check if your page builder has custom authentication page settings enabled. Page builders like Bricks Builder, Elementor Pro, and Divi often have settings that redirect wp-login.php to custom pages, which conflicts with WordPress's default password form submission.

	**Solution for Bricks Builder**: Go to Bricks → Settings → General → Custom authentication pages, and disable the "Login Page" setting.

	**Solution for other page builders**: Look for similar "custom login page" or "authentication page" settings in your page builder's configuration and disable them.

	**Why does magic link work?** Magic link forms submit to the current page, while WordPress's password form (wp_login_form) submits to wp-login.php, which gets intercepted by the page builder.

= I can't find a question similar to my issue; Where can I find support? =

	For plugin support, please use the WordPress.org support forum for Keyless Auth. For bug reports and feature requests, you can also visit our GitHub repository. For support with the original Passwordless Login functionality, visit http://www.cozmoslabs.com.
